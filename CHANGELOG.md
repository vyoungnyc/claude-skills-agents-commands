# Changelog

All notable changes to this multi-agent orchestration system are documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 1: Modernize for Claude Code v2.1.86

This release updates the multi-agent orchestration from Claude Code v2.0.25 patterns to v2.1.86 native capabilities, while preserving the structured workflow, gated approvals, and strict delegation model.

### Removed

- **RAG agent** — Agents now query MCP tools (Context7, Chunkhound) directly. Claude Code's Tool Search feature (introduced v2.1.76) automatically defers tool loading when definitions exceed 10% of context, providing ~85% token savings. A dedicated routing agent is no longer needed.
- **session-checkpoint skill** — Replaced by native auto-memory + PostCompact hook. Claude Code handles context compaction automatically. The PostCompact hook in `hooks/reinject-context.sh` re-injects critical project standards after compaction without manual intervention.
- **Duplicated git/test-runner reference sections** in agent definitions — These bloated every agent file. Git workflow and test failure routing are now documented once in the commands and will be enforced by hooks in Phase 2.

### Added

- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/reinject-context.sh` + `hooks/settings.json`) — Automatically re-injects project standards, workflow rules, and context hierarchy after context compaction. Replaces the manual session-checkpoint skill that required agents to monitor their own usage at ~85% thresholds.
- **`memory: project`** on all long-lived agents — Reviewer, architect, security-researcher, and others now persist learnings across sessions. A reviewer that has reviewed your codebase 20 times actually learns your conventions.
- **`isolation: worktree`** on backend-coder and frontend-coder — Each coder gets its own copy of the repo via git worktrees. Eliminates the file-ownership coordination rules the orchestrator previously enforced. Worktrees are auto-cleaned if the agent makes no changes.
- **`permissionMode: plan`** on reviewer and security-researcher — These agents are structurally read-only. They can read and analyze but cannot modify code, preventing accidental changes during review.
- **`model:` tuning per agent** — opus for architectural/review reasoning, sonnet for implementation, haiku for documentation. Reduces cost without sacrificing quality where it matters.
- **`maxTurns:` limits per agent** — Prevents runaway agent execution. Tuned per role: 50 for orchestrator, 30 for coders, 15-25 for others.
- **MCP tool access on agents** — Architect, coders, ui-ux, and test-spec now have direct `mcp__context7` and/or `mcp__chunkhound` in their tools list, eliminating the RAG intermediary.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md** — Updated agent spawning pattern to reflect new frontmatter (model, isolation, memory, permissionMode). Removed Task tool pseudocode example, replaced with named agent table.
- **feature-autopilot command** — Added v2 change notes documenting what's different. Removed RAG orchestration steps, session checkpoint references. Added worktree isolation notes for coders.
- **All agent definitions** — Streamlined by ~40-60% by removing duplicated git workflow reference sections, test-runner routing templates, and session-checkpoint boilerplate. Each agent now focuses on its core mission.
- **Agent count** — Reduced from 11 to 10 (RAG agent removed). Remaining: orchestrator, architect, planner, backend-coder, frontend-coder, test-spec, reviewer, security-researcher, documenter, ui-ux.
- **Skill count** — Reduced from 13 to 12 (session-checkpoint removed). All other skills remain unchanged.

### Migration Notes

If upgrading from v1:
1. Remove the `agents/rag.md` file from your `.claude/agents/` directory.
2. Remove the `skills/session-checkpoint/` directory.
3. Copy `hooks/reinject-context.sh` to `.claude/hooks/` and make it executable (`chmod +x`).
4. Merge `hooks/settings.json` into your `.claude/settings.json` under the `"hooks"` key.
5. Replace all agent files in `.claude/agents/` with the v2 versions.
6. Replace the `commands/feature-autopilot.md` with the v2 version.
7. Update your `CLAUDE.md` with the new agent spawning pattern section.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 2: Native Hook Automation

This release replaces manual coordination patterns (orchestrator routing test failures, enforcing git conventions in agent prompts) with deterministic hooks that execute 100% of the time.

### Added

- **Auto-test runner hook** (`hooks/auto-test-runner.sh`) — PostToolUse async hook that runs the test suite in background after any source file edit. Detects Jest or Vitest automatically. Skips docs, config, and non-source files. Results delivered as a systemMessage on the next turn, with failure output routed for triage. Replaces the orchestrator's manual "call /backend-test-runner after coders finish" coordination pattern.

- **Git convention enforcement hook** (`hooks/enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — PreToolUse hook on all `git *` commands. Enforces:
  - Conventional commit format (`feat|fix|refactor|test|docs|chore(scope): subject`)
  - Branch naming convention (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`)
  - Blocks `git push --force` (suggests `--force-with-lease`)
  - Blocks direct push to `main`/`master`
  - Blocks `--no-verify` flag
  - Uses conditional hook (`if: "Bash(git *)"`) so the script only spawns for git commands, not every Bash call.

- **Auto-format hook** (`hooks/auto-format.sh`) — PostToolUse hook that runs Prettier and ESLint fix on edited source files (TS/JS/TSX/JSX/CSS). Runs synchronously before the async test runner so tests run against formatted code. Skips non-source files.

- **Auto-approve safe operations hook** (`hooks/auto-approve-safe-ops.sh`) — PermissionRequest hook that auto-approves known-safe Bash commands: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npx jest`, `npx vitest`, `npx playwright test`, `npx prettier`, `npx eslint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git branch`, and similar read-only/non-destructive operations. Reduces permission prompt fatigue without compromising safety.

### Changed

- **`hooks/settings.json`** — Now includes all four hook categories: PostCompact (from Phase 1), PreToolUse (git enforcement), PostToolUse (auto-format + async test runner), and PermissionRequest (auto-approve). The PostToolUse hooks chain: format runs first (sync), then tests run in background (async).

### How the hooks chain works

```
You edit a file
  → PostToolUse fires
    → auto-format.sh runs (sync) — Prettier + ESLint fix
    → auto-test-runner.sh runs (async, background)
      → Tests pass → systemMessage: "Tests passing after editing src/auth.ts (8 passed)"
      → Tests fail → systemMessage: "TESTS FAILED... Route to test-spec or coder agent"
  → Claude continues working while tests run

You run a git commit
  → PreToolUse fires (conditional: only git commands)
    → enforce-git-conventions.sh checks:
      ✓ Conventional commit message format
      ✓ No force-push
      ✓ No push to main
      ✓ No --no-verify
    → Blocks with explanation if violated, proceeds if valid

You need to run npm test
  → PermissionRequest fires
    → auto-approve-safe-ops.sh matches "npm test"
    → Auto-approved, no dialog shown
```

### Migration Notes (Phase 1 → Phase 2)

1. Copy new hook scripts to `.claude/hooks/`:
   - `auto-test-runner.sh`
   - `enforce-git-conventions.sh`
   - `auto-format.sh`
   - `auto-approve-safe-ops.sh`
2. Make all executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh`
3. Replace your `.claude/settings.json` hooks section with the updated `hooks/settings.json` content (or merge manually).
4. Ensure `jq` is installed (used by all hook scripts for JSON parsing).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 3: Agent Teams Integration

This release adds agent teams as an optional parallel execution pattern alongside the existing subagent dispatch. Agent teams enable true peer-to-peer communication between agents working on independent modules.

### Added

- **Agent Teams Guide** (`docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`) — Comprehensive documentation covering:
  - When to use agent teams vs subagents (decision framework)
  - Four team patterns: parallel module development, multi-perspective review, competing hypotheses (bug investigation), and architecture exploration
  - File domain assignment rules (critical for teams — no worktree isolation)
  - Cost optimization strategies (~7x token cost vs standard sessions)
  - Limitations and risks

- **`/team-autopilot` command** (`commands/team-autopilot.md`) — Team-based alternative to `/feature-autopilot`. Uses agent teams for the implementation phase when backend + frontend can be built simultaneously on non-overlapping file domains. Phases:
  - Phase 1 (Design): subagents — architect → planner → plan approval (sequential, same as feature-autopilot)
  - Phase 2 (Implementation): agent team — parallel teammates with file domain assignments and SendMessage coordination
  - Phase 3 (Quality gates): subagents — tests → security → review → docs (sequential gating, same as feature-autopilot)
  - Includes fallback criteria: when to abandon team and switch to subagents mid-workflow

- **Agent teams environment flag** in `hooks/settings.json` — Enables the experimental agent teams feature:
  ```json
  { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
  ```

### Changed

- **Orchestrator** (`agents/orchestrator.md`) — Added parallel execution decision framework. The orchestrator now evaluates whether to use subagents (default) or agent teams for each batch of parallel steps. Includes:
  - Decision tree: sequential/gated → subagents, independent modules → consider teams, multi-perspective → teams
  - Team creation template with file domain assignments
  - Critical team rules (non-overlapping domains, 3-5 teammates, verify completion)

- **CLAUDE.md** — Added Pattern B (agent teams) alongside the existing Pattern A (subagents) in the Agent Spawning Patterns section. Added reference to `docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`.

- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/reinject-context.sh`) — Added agent team workflow reminders (file domain rule, subagents vs teams).

### Architecture: Subagents vs Agent Teams

```
SUBAGENTS (Hub-and-Spoke) — Default
  Orchestrator
    ├→ backend-coder (worktree isolation)    ←─ results flow back
    ├→ frontend-coder (worktree isolation)   ←─ results flow back
    └→ test-spec                             ←─ results flow back
  ✓ Worktree isolation available
  ✓ Lower token cost
  ✓ Full gating control
  ✗ No peer communication

AGENT TEAMS (Peer-to-Peer) — For parallel independent modules
  Team Lead (orchestrator)
    ├←→ Backend teammate (owns src/backend/)   ←→ peer messages
    ├←→ Frontend teammate (owns src/frontend/) ←→ peer messages
    └←→ Test teammate (owns tests/)            ←→ peer messages
  ✓ Direct peer communication via SendMessage
  ✓ True parallel execution
  ✗ No worktree isolation (must assign file domains)
  ✗ Higher token cost (~7x)
  ✗ Experimental feature
```

### When to use which

| Scenario | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Standard gated workflow (plan → implement → test → review) | Subagents |
| Sequential steps with strict ordering | Subagents |
| Overlapping file changes | Subagents (worktree isolation) |
| 2+ independent modules, separate file domains | Agent teams |
| Multi-perspective review (security + performance + architecture) | Agent teams |
| Bug investigation with multiple hypotheses | Agent teams |
| Architecture exploration with competing designs | Agent teams |

### Migration Notes (Phase 2 → Phase 3)

1. Merge the new `env` section from `hooks/settings.json` into your `.claude/settings.json`.
2. Copy `commands/team-autopilot.md` to `.claude/commands/`.
3. Create the `docs/` directory and copy `docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`.
4. Replace `agents/orchestrator.md` with the v2.2 version.
5. Update your `CLAUDE.md` with the new Pattern B section.
6. Update `hooks/reinject-context.sh` with the agent teams reminders.
7. **Note:** Agent teams are experimental. The standard subagent workflow remains the default and is unchanged.

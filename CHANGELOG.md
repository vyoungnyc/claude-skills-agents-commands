## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-30

### Phase 3.1: Hook Hardening & PR Fix Loop Enhancements

Security hardening for git convention and auto-approve hooks based on automated code review (Codex), plus a major upgrade to the `/pr-fix-loop` command.

### Fixed

- **Force-push `-f` bypass** (`enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — The regex only matched `-f` with a preceding space, so `git push -f origin branch` (where `-f` immediately follows `push`) slipped through. Fixed by restructuring the pattern to allow `-f` at any position after `push`.

- **Clustered `-fu` flag bypass** (`enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — Git accepts combined short options like `-fu` (`-f` + `-u`), but the regex only matched standalone `-f` followed by whitespace/end. Changed to `-[a-zA-Z]*f[a-zA-Z]*(\s|$)` to catch `-fu`, `-uf`, `-fvu`, etc.

- **`refs/heads/main` refspec bypass** (`enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — Full ref paths like `git push origin refs/heads/main` and `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` bypassed the protected branch check. Added `(refs/heads/)?` optional group to all patterns.

- **`--delete main` bypass** (`enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — `git push origin --delete main` bypassed the check because `--delete` sits between the remote and branch name. Added a dedicated pattern for `(-d|--delete)\s+(refs/heads/)?(main|master)`.

- **`\b` false positive on `main-feature`** (`enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — `\b` treats `-` as a word boundary, so `git push origin main-feature` was incorrectly blocked. Replaced `\b` with `(\s|$)` in all protected-branch patterns.

- **Single `&` bypass** (`auto-approve-safe-ops.sh`) — The unsafe metacharacter filter caught `&&` but not standalone `&`, allowing `git status & rm -rf /tmp/x` to pass the safe-prefix check. Added `&` to the filter.

### Changed

- **`/pr-fix-loop` command** — Major enhancements:
  - **Multi-bot support** — Now recognizes Codex (`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`), Cursor BugBot (`cursor-bugbot[bot]`), and GitLab Copilot (`gitlab-copilot[bot]`) as review bots.
  - **Removed `@codex review` triggers** — Review bots auto-review on every push; no manual trigger needed.
  - **User comment triage** — Human reviewer comments are now triaged with the same Category A (fix) / B (push back) / C (clarify) logic as bot comments.
  - **`@codex review the feedback` tag** — Category B (disagree) and Category C (unclear) replies to Codex end with `@codex review the feedback` to prompt re-evaluation.
  - **Bot follow-up resolution** — If a bot responds to a disputed thread and its reply satisfies concerns, the thread is resolved. Otherwise, re-triage as B or C and continue the loop.
  - **Mandatory approval gate** — The 👍 or ✅ emoji on the PR description from a bot reviewer is the mandatory approval signal. Positive text like "Didn't find any major issues" complements but does not replace the emoji gate. Loop also ends on 15 consecutive minutes idle (reported as unapproved).

- **README.md** — Updated `/pr-fix-loop` description in commands table. Updated quick-start hook install to copy all `*.sh` files.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 1: Modernize for Claude Code v2.1.86

This release updates the multi-agent orchestration from Claude Code v2.0.25 patterns to v2.1.86 native capabilities, while preserving the structured workflow, gated approvals, and strict delegation model.

### Removed

- **RAG agent** — Agents now query MCP tools (Context7, Chunkhound) directly. Claude Code's Tool Search feature (introduced v2.1.76) automatically defers tool loading when definitions exceed 10% of context, providing ~85% token savings. A dedicated routing agent is no longer needed.
- **session-checkpoint skill** — Replaced by native auto-memory + PostCompact hook. Claude Code handles context compaction automatically. The PostCompact hook in `hooks/reinject-context.sh` re-injects critical project standards after compaction without manual intervention.
- **Duplicated git/test-runner reference sections** in agent definitions — These bloated every agent file. Git workflow and test failure routing are now documented once in the commands and will be enforced by hooks in Phase 2.

### Added

- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/reinject-context.sh` + `hooks/settings.json`) — Automatically re-injects project standards, workflow rules, and context hierarchy after context compaction. Replaces the manual session-checkpoint skill that required agents to monitor their own usage at ~85% thresholds.
- **`memory: project`** on all long-lived agents — Reviewer, architect, security-researcher, and others now persist learnings across sessions. A reviewer that has reviewed your codebase 20 times actually learns your conventions.
- **`isolation: worktree`** on backend-coder and frontend-coder — Each coder gets its own copy of the repo via git worktrees. Eliminates the file-ownership coordination rules the orchestrator previously enforced. Worktrees are auto-cleaned if the agent makes no changes.
- **`permissionMode: plan`** on reviewer and security-researcher — These agents are structurally read-only. They can read and analyze but cannot modify code, preventing accidental changes during review.
- **`model:` tuning per agent** — opus for architectural/review reasoning, sonnet for implementation, haiku for documentation. Reduces cost without sacrificing quality where it matters.
- **`maxTurns:` limits per agent** — Prevents runaway agent execution. Tuned per role: 50 for orchestrator, 30 for coders, 15-25 for others.
- **MCP tool access on agents** — Architect, coders, ui-ux, and test-spec now have direct `mcp__context7` and/or `mcp__chunkhound` in their tools list, eliminating the RAG intermediary.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md** — Updated agent spawning pattern to reflect new frontmatter (model, isolation, memory, permissionMode). Removed Task tool pseudocode example, replaced with named agent table.
- **feature-autopilot command** — Added v2 change notes documenting what's different. Removed RAG orchestration steps, session checkpoint references. Added worktree isolation notes for coders.
- **All agent definitions** — Streamlined by ~40-60% by removing duplicated git workflow reference sections, test-runner routing templates, and session-checkpoint boilerplate. Each agent now focuses on its core mission.
- **Agent count** — Reduced from 11 to 10 (RAG agent removed). Remaining: orchestrator, architect, planner, backend-coder, frontend-coder, test-spec, reviewer, security-researcher, documenter, ui-ux.
- **Skill count** — Reduced from 13 to 12 (session-checkpoint removed). All other skills remain unchanged.

### Migration Notes

If upgrading from v1:
1. Remove the `agents/rag.md` file from your `.claude/agents/` directory.
2. Remove the `skills/session-checkpoint/` directory.
3. Copy `hooks/reinject-context.sh` to `.claude/hooks/` and make it executable (`chmod +x`).
4. Merge `hooks/settings.json` into your `.claude/settings.json` under the `"hooks"` key.
5. Replace all agent files in `.claude/agents/` with the v2 versions.
6. Replace the `commands/feature-autopilot.md` with the v2 version.
7. Update your `CLAUDE.md` with the new agent spawning pattern section.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 2: Native Hook Automation

This release replaces manual coordination patterns (orchestrator routing test failures, enforcing git conventions in agent prompts) with deterministic hooks that execute 100% of the time.

### Added

- **Auto-test runner hook** (`hooks/auto-test-runner.sh`) — PostToolUse async hook that runs the test suite in background after any source file edit. Detects Jest or Vitest automatically. Skips docs, config, and non-source files. Results delivered as a systemMessage on the next turn, with failure output routed for triage. Replaces the orchestrator's manual "call /backend-test-runner after coders finish" coordination pattern.

- **Git convention enforcement hook** (`hooks/enforce-git-conventions.sh`) — PreToolUse hook on all `git *` commands. Enforces:
  - Conventional commit format (`feat|fix|refactor|test|docs|chore(scope): subject`)
  - Branch naming convention (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `refactor/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`)
  - Blocks `git push --force` (suggests `--force-with-lease`)
  - Blocks direct push to `main`/`master`
  - Blocks `--no-verify` flag
  - Uses conditional hook (`if: "Bash(git *)"`) so the script only spawns for git commands, not every Bash call.

- **Auto-format hook** (`hooks/auto-format.sh`) — PostToolUse hook that runs Prettier and ESLint fix on edited source files (TS/JS/TSX/JSX/CSS). Runs synchronously before the async test runner so tests run against formatted code. Skips non-source files.

- **Auto-approve safe operations hook** (`hooks/auto-approve-safe-ops.sh`) — PermissionRequest hook that auto-approves known-safe Bash commands: `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npx jest`, `npx vitest`, `npx playwright test`, `npx prettier`, `npx eslint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git branch`, and similar read-only/non-destructive operations. Reduces permission prompt fatigue without compromising safety.

### Changed

- **`hooks/settings.json`** — Now includes all four hook categories: PostCompact (from Phase 1), PreToolUse (git enforcement), PostToolUse (auto-format + async test runner), and PermissionRequest (auto-approve). The PostToolUse hooks chain: format runs first (sync), then tests run in background (async).

### How the hooks chain works

```
You edit a file
  → PostToolUse fires
    → auto-format.sh runs (sync) — Prettier + ESLint fix
    → auto-test-runner.sh runs (async, background)
      → Tests pass → systemMessage: "Tests passing after editing src/auth.ts (8 passed)"
      → Tests fail → systemMessage: "TESTS FAILED... Route to test-spec or coder agent"
  → Claude continues working while tests run

You run a git commit
  → PreToolUse fires (conditional: only git commands)
    → enforce-git-conventions.sh checks:
      ✓ Conventional commit message format
      ✓ No force-push
      ✓ No push to main
      ✓ No --no-verify
    → Blocks with explanation if violated, proceeds if valid

You need to run npm test
  → PermissionRequest fires
    → auto-approve-safe-ops.sh matches "npm test"
    → Auto-approved, no dialog shown
```

### Migration Notes (Phase 1 → Phase 2)

1. Copy new hook scripts to `.claude/hooks/`:
   - `auto-test-runner.sh`
   - `enforce-git-conventions.sh`
   - `auto-format.sh`
   - `auto-approve-safe-ops.sh`
2. Make all executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh`
3. Replace your `.claude/settings.json` hooks section with the updated `hooks/settings.json` content (or merge manually).
4. Ensure `jq` is installed (used by all hook scripts for JSON parsing).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-29

### Phase 3: Agent Teams Integration

This release adds agent teams as an optional parallel execution pattern alongside the existing subagent dispatch. Agent teams enable true peer-to-peer communication between agents working on independent modules.

### Added

- **Agent Teams Guide** (`docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`) — Comprehensive documentation covering:
  - When to use agent teams vs subagents (decision framework)
  - Four team patterns: parallel module development, multi-perspective review, competing hypotheses (bug investigation), and architecture exploration
  - File domain assignment rules (critical for teams — no worktree isolation)
  - Cost optimization strategies (~7x token cost vs standard sessions)
  - Limitations and risks

- **`/feature-autopilot` parallel mode** — `/feature-autopilot` now accepts `mode=parallel` for team-based implementation (merged from former `/team-autopilot`). Uses agent teams for the implementation phase when backend + frontend can be built simultaneously on non-overlapping file domains. Auto-detects when parallel mode is appropriate if not specified.

- **Agent teams environment flag** in `hooks/settings.json` — Enables the experimental agent teams feature:
  ```json
  { "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
  ```

### Changed

- **Orchestrator** (`agents/orchestrator.md`) — Added parallel execution decision framework. The orchestrator now evaluates whether to use subagents (default) or agent teams for each batch of parallel steps. Includes:
  - Decision tree: sequential/gated → subagents, independent modules → consider teams, multi-perspective → teams
  - Team creation template with file domain assignments
  - Critical team rules (non-overlapping domains, 3-5 teammates, verify completion)

- **CLAUDE.md** — Added Pattern B (agent teams) alongside the existing Pattern A (subagents) in the Agent Spawning Patterns section. Added reference to `docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`.

- **PostCompact hook** (`hooks/reinject-context.sh`) — Added agent team workflow reminders (file domain rule, subagents vs teams).

### Architecture: Subagents vs Agent Teams

```
SUBAGENTS (Hub-and-Spoke) — Default
  Orchestrator
    ├→ backend-coder (worktree isolation)    ←─ results flow back
    ├→ frontend-coder (worktree isolation)   ←─ results flow back
    └→ test-spec                             ←─ results flow back
  ✓ Worktree isolation available
  ✓ Lower token cost
  ✓ Full gating control
  ✗ No peer communication

AGENT TEAMS (Peer-to-Peer) — For parallel independent modules
  Team Lead (orchestrator)
    ├←→ Backend teammate (owns src/backend/)   ←→ peer messages
    ├←→ Frontend teammate (owns src/frontend/) ←→ peer messages
    └←→ Test teammate (owns tests/)            ←→ peer messages
  ✓ Direct peer communication via SendMessage
  ✓ True parallel execution
  ✗ No worktree isolation (must assign file domains)
  ✗ Higher token cost (~7x)
  ✗ Experimental feature
```

### When to use which

| Scenario | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Standard gated workflow (plan → implement → test → review) | Subagents |
| Sequential steps with strict ordering | Subagents |
| Overlapping file changes | Subagents (worktree isolation) |
| 2+ independent modules, separate file domains | Agent teams |
| Multi-perspective review (security + performance + architecture) | Agent teams |
| Bug investigation with multiple hypotheses | Agent teams |
| Architecture exploration with competing designs | Agent teams |

### Migration Notes (Phase 2 → Phase 3)

1. Merge the new `env` section from `hooks/settings.json` into your `.claude/settings.json`.
2. `/team-autopilot` has been merged into `/feature-autopilot` (use `mode=parallel`).
3. Create the `docs/` directory and copy `docs/AGENT_TEAMS_GUIDE.md`.
4. Replace `agents/orchestrator.md` with the v2.2 version.
5. Update your `CLAUDE.md` with the new Pattern B section.
6. Update `hooks/reinject-context.sh` with the agent teams reminders.
7. **Note:** Agent teams are experimental. The standard subagent workflow remains the default and is unchanged.
